rr.opt.mcts.basic
=================

A pure-Python toy implementation of Monte Carlo tree search. This simple version can be used to get a basic understanding of the algorithm and do some small experiments. When you feel comfortable, you should check out the full-blown implementation ``rr.opt.mcts.full``, which has many more features.


Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/2xR/rr.opt.mcts.basic.git
    pip install ./rr.opt.mcts.basic

Contributions are welcome through github pull requests (tests would sure be nice to have... :P).

And if you're using the library and would like to say *"thanks!"* and/or keep me working on it, why not `buy me a beer <https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=2UMJC8HSU8RFJ&lc=PT&item_name=DoubleR&item_number=github%2f2xR%2fpaypal&currency_code=EUR&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted>`_?
